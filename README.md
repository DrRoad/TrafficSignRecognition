# TrafficSignRecognition
A Deep Neural Network to do traffic sign recognition
* A lot has happened since MobilEye developed the first commercially deployed traffic sign recognition system in collaboration with Continental AG for the BMW-7 series vehicles. Quite a few vehicles have used this technology since. 
* Establishing a reliable Traffic Sign Classification mechanism is a major step in our journey towards building semi-autonomous/autonomous driving systems.
* This post intends to explain an approach to solve the problem of traffic sign classification and I intend to show how easy it is, to build, train and deploy a deep learning network for traffic sign classification.
# Highlights of this approach
* The traffic sign dataset that we will be working on is GTSRB — German Traffic Signs. 
* The approach used is deep learning.
* The type of neural network used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) paired with a linear classifier.
* Python is the language used to program this.
* The complete source code can be found here
