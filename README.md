# TrafficSignRecognition
A Deep Neural Network to do traffic sign recognition
# Highlights of this approach
### The traffic sign dataset that we will be working on is GTSRB — German Traffic Signs. 
### The approach used is deep learning.
### The type of neural network used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) paired with a linear classifier.
### Python is the language used to program this.
